# Task
Given the following sections from some rare unknown commentary of tarka sangraha, 
suggest a suitable title for the below `Target section`. 
Title should be unique as compared to the previous and next sections. 
Title should represent the topic in `Target section` clearly and completely. 
Title has to be a single sanskrit word with proper vibhakti, linga and vachanam.
The expected style of titles can be seen from `Some sample titles`. 
But do not get restricted to only these examples. These titles have to represent the topics in Tarka Shastra.
