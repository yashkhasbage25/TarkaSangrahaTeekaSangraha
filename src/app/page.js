                <b>Why this website?</b><br/>
                Everyone visiting this website will surely agree that <i>TarkaSangraha</i> is a great work of अन्नम्भट्टाचार्य, and it is one of the
                most important texts for the students of Tarka. Everyone suggests to read TarkaSangraha as a beginner. Even the टीका-s based on it 
                are recommended for the advanced students. 
                <br/>
                So, this book is heavily read but not avaiable freely with all its टीका-s? Doesn't seem good. This website this the solution!!
                <br/>

                I am just a learner of न्याय-वैशेषिक-तर्क subjects. My knowledge stands nowhere in front of the huge ancient literature have.<br/>
                I would request the interested Āchāryas to contribute their knowledge and feedback to this effort.<br/>
